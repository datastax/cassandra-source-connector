= About DataStax Cassandra Source Connector

DataStax Cassandra® Source Connector is open-source software (OSS) that send Cassandra mutations
for table having the CDC enabled to Apache Pulsar&reg; or Apache Kafka&reg;.
, which in turn can write the data to platforms such as Elasticsearch&reg; or Snowflake&reg;.

== Key Features

* Support both Apache Cassandra 3.11.x and 4.0.x
* Support Apache Pulsar or Apache Kafka.
* Propagate Cassandra schema change to the Apache/Kafka schema registry
* Support JSON or AVRO message format.

== Limitations

* Does not manage table truncates
* Does not replay batch updates
* Does not sync data available before starting the CDC producer.
* Does not manage time-to-live
* Does not support range deletes

== Architecture

The DataStax Cassandra® Source Connector two components:
* A event producer deployed as a JVM agent on each Cassandra data node.
* A Cassandra source connector deployed in your streaming platform.

The following diagram describes the general architecture.

When CDC is enabled for a given Cassandra table, the event producer emit a message for each Cassandra mutation
in a per-table events topic. Then the source connector process these events, it fetches the mutated Cassandra row,
and writes it to the data topic. This ensures the most recent state of the Cassandra table is replicated into
the data topic without the need to time re-order Cassandra mutations.
The Cassandra Source Connector also update the schema-registry to reflects the Cassandra table schema.

Deployment matrix:

| Streaming platform | Cassandra v3.x producer | Cassandra v4.x producer  | Source connector |
| ---                | ---                     | ---                      | ---              |
| Apache Pulsar      | [producer-v3-pulsar](producer-v3-pulsar) | [producer-v4-pulsar](producer-v4-pulsar) | [source-pulsar](source-pulsar) |
| Apache Kafka       | [producer-v3-kafka](producer-v3-kafka)   | [producer-v4-kafka](producer-v4-kafka)   | [source-kafka](source-kafka)   |
