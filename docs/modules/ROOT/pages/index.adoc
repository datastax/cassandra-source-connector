= About {cdc_cass}

{cdc_cass_first} is open-source software (OSS) that sends Cassandra mutations
for tables having Change Data Capture (CDC) enabled to https://www.datastax.com/products/luna-streaming[Luna Streaming] or https://pulsar.apache.org/[Apache Pulsar™], which in turn can write the data to platforms such as Elasticsearch® or Snowflake®.

== Key Features

* Supports Apache Cassandra 3.11+, 4.0+, and Datastax Enterprise Server 6.8.16+
* Supports Luna Streaming 2.7.2+ and Apache Pulsar 2.8.1+
* De-duplicates updates from multiple replicas
* Propagates Cassandra schema change to the built-in Pulsar schema registry
* Supports AVRO message format


== Architecture

{cdc_cass} has two components:

* DataStax Change Agent for Apache Cassandra, which is an event producer deployed as a JVM agent on each Cassandra data node
* {csc_pulsar_first}, which is a source connector deployed in your streaming platform

The following diagram describes the general architecture.

Since version 3.0, Cassandra has included a change data capture (CDC) feature.
The CDC feature can be enabled on the table level by setting the table property cdc=true, after which any commit log containing data for a CDC-enabled table will be moved to the CDC directory specified in `cassandra.yaml` on discard/flush (default: `cdc_raw`).
Since Cassandra 4.0, commit logs can be synced to the `cdc_raw` directory periodically (by default, 10 seconds).

When CDC is enabled:

. The change agent running on each node reads the Cassandra `commitlog` files in the `cdc_raw` directory and emits a message for each Cassandra mutation on a CDC-enabled table to a per-table events topic.
. The {csc_pulsar} processes these events and fetches the mutated Cassandra row.
. The {csc_pulsar} writes the row into the data topic. This ensures the most recent state of the Cassandra table is replicated into the data topic without the need to time re-order Cassandra mutations.
. Once the change agent processes all mutations in the commit log, it deletes the file from the `cdc_raw` directory.

{cdc_cass} is tolerant of failures when processing the commit logs in the `cdc_raw` directory.
It maintains a processing offset for each commit log.
If the change agent restarts, {cdc_cass} picks up where it left off using the recorded offset value.

The following table describes what is published to the data topic for each update to a CDC-enabled Cassandra table.

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Type | Event Data
| insert | Key set to primary key of the row, value set to all column values
| update | Key set to primary key of the row, value set to all column values
| delete | Key set to primary key of the row, value set to null
|===

The {csc_pulsar} updates the schema registry to dynamically reflect the Cassandra table schema.
You can then deploy various sink connectors to replicate data into the backends of your choice.
For more, see https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/io-connectors/#sink-connector[Pulsar built-in sink connectors].

Sink connectors processing messages from the data topic should interpret an event with a null value as a delete.
For example, with the Pulsar Elasticsearch connector, you need to set `nullValueAction` to `DELETE`.

The change agent runs on all Cassandra data nodes.
This means that the agent processes the original write plus its replicas.
To minimize the number of duplicate events that end up in the data topic, the {csc_pulsar} maintains an in-memory de-duplication cache.
For each update to the table, an MD5 digest is calculated to de-duplicate the updates from the replicas.

[#supported-databases]
== Supported databases

* Apache Cassandra® 3.11.x and 4.x databases
* Datastax Server Enterprise 6.8.16+

== Supported Cassandra data structures

The following Cassandra CQL3 data types (with the associated AVRO type or logical-type) are supported:

* text (string)
* ascii (string)
* tinyint (int)
* smallint (int)
* int (int)
* bigint (long)
* double (double)
* float (float)
* inet (string)
* decimal (cql_decimal)
* varint (cql_varint)
* duration (cql_duration)
* blob(bytes)
* boolean (boolean)
* timestamp (timestamp-millis)
* time (time-micros)
* date (date)
* uuid (uuid)
* timeuuid (uuid)
* User Defined Types (record)
* Collection types:
** list (array)
** set (array)
** map (map)

Cassandra static columns are supported:

* On row-level updates, static columns are included in the message value.
* On partition-level updates, the clustering keys are null in the message key, and the message value only has static columns on `insert`/`update` operations.

For data types that are not supported, columns using those data types are omitted from the events sent to the data topic.
If a row update contains both supported and unsupported data types, the event will include only columns with supported data types.

== Limitations

{cdc_cass} has the following limitations:

* Does not manage table truncates.
* Does not sync data available before starting the CDC agent.
* Does not replay logged batches.
* Does not manage time-to-live.
* Does not support range deletes.
* CQL column names must not match a Pulsar primitive type name (ex: INT32).

== Deployment

=== Schema updates on topics

Schema registry updates on a Pulsar topic are controlled by the `is-allow-auto-update-schema` option.

* `true` allows the broker to register a new schema for a topic and connect the producer if the schema is not registered.
* `false` rejects the producer's connection to the broker if the schema is not registered.

To ensure the {csc_pulsar} can automatically update the schema on the Pulsar topic, set the option to `true`. For more, see https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/schema-manage/[Schema Auto-Update].

=== Multiple Cassandra datacenters

In a multi-datacenter Cassandra configuration, enable CDC and install the change agent in only one datacenter.
To ensure the data sent to all datacenters are delivered to the data topic, make sure to configure replication to the datacenter that has CDC enabled on the table.

For example, given a Cassandra cluster with three datacenters (DC1, DC2, and DC3), you would enable CDC and install the change agent in only DC1.
To ensure all updates in DC2 and DC3 are propagated to the data topic, configure the table's keyspace to replicate data from DC2 and DC3 to DC1.
For example, `replication = {'class': 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 'dc1': 3, 'dc2': 3, 'dc3': 3})`.
The data replicated to DC1 will be processed by the change agent and eventually end up in the data topic.
