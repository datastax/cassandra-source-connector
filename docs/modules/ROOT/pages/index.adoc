= About DataStax Cassandra Source Connector

DataStax Cassandra&reg; Source Connector (CSC) is open-source software (OSS) that sends Cassandra mutations for a table that has Change Data Capture (CDC) enabled to Apache Pulsar&reg;.  This can then be written to other platforms such as Elasticsearch&reg; or Snowflake&reg;.

== Key Features

* Supports Apache Cassandra 3.11.x and 4.0.x
* Supports Apache Pulsar
* Propagates Cassandra schema changes to the Apache Pulsar schema registry
* Supports JSON or AVRO message format

== Limitations

* Does not manage table truncates.
* Does not replay batch updates.
* Does not sync data available before starting the CDC producer.
* Does not manage time-to-live.
* Does not support range deletes.

== Architecture

The DataStax Cassandra速 Source Connector two components:

* A event producer deployed as a JVM agent on each Cassandra data node.
* A Cassandra source connector deployed in your streaming platform.

The following diagram describes the general architecture.

When CDC is enabled for a given Cassandra table, the event producer emits a message for each Cassandra mutation in a per-table **events topic**. Then the source connector process these events, fetches the mutated Cassandra row, and writes it to the **data topic**. 

This ensures the most recent state of the Cassandra table is replicated into the data topic without the need to time re-order Cassandra mutations.

The Cassandra Source Connector also updates the schema-registry to reflects the Cassandra table schema.
