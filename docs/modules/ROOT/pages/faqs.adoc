= Cassandra Source Connector FAQs

If you are new to DataStax Cassandra Source Connector, these FAQs are for you.

== Introduction

=== What is DataStax Cassandra Source Connector?

The Alpha release of Cassandra Source Connector is a new, open-source product from DataStax.
With CDC, your apps can consume data from an Apache Cassandra table and put the updates onto a Pulsar topic, which in turn can write the data to external targets such as Elastic, Snowflake, and other platforms. By design, the Source component is simple, with a 1:1 correspondence between the Cassandra table and a single Pulsar topic.

=== What are the system requirements for Cassandra Source Connector?

Minimum system requirement are:

* Cassandra 3.11 or 4.0+,
* Luna Streaming 2.7.2
* Additional memory and CPU available on all nodes

=== What are the Cassandra Source Connector limitations?

The Cassandra Source Connector:

* Does not replay logged batches
* Does not manage table truncates
* Does not sync data available before starting the CDC producer.
* Does not manage TTL
* Does not support range deletes

=== Is DataStax Cassandra Data Connector an open-source project?

Yes, DataStax Cassandra Data Connector is open source. See the <<gitHubRepos,repos FAQ>>.

=== What does Cassandra Source Connector provide that I cannot get with open-source Apache Pulsar?

The DataStax Cassandra Source Connector implements, in effect, the reverse of Apache Pulsar or DataStax Cassandra Sink Connector. With the CSC, the source takes data from Cassandra and puts that data onto a data topic. From there, the data can be published to external platforms like Snowflake, Elasticsearch, and so on.

=== Which Kubernetes platforms are supported by DataStax Cassandra Source Connector?

They include Minikube, K8d, Kind, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service, Amazon Kubernetes Service (AKS), and other commonly used platforms. You can also deploy the CDC producer with the https://github.com/datastax/cass-operator[cass-operator].
